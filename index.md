# Greetings! Bonjou!

## Who am I? 

My name is **Gabrielle Mary Jean-Louis** and I am an English Ph.D. student at the University of Miami. My research interests lie in Caribbean Studies, more specifically Haitian Diasporic Studies and Global Black Feminist Theory. I am from Elmont, New York, a small town on the border of Queens. It is there that I learned about what it means to be a diasporic subject, particularly in the United States of America. My scholarship focuses on the articulations of diasporic and migrant experiences in Haitian Women's writing and art. I have presented my work at a number of Mellon Mays Student Conferences as well as the Modern Language Association Annual Convention. My work will be found in the Perez Art Museum (Miami) Caribbean Cultural Institute in the coming year.
